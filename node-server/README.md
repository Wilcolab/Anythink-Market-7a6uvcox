# My Express Server

This project is a simple Express server that listens on port 8001. It is set up to automatically restart on code changes using nodemon.

## Project Structure

The project has the following files and directories:

- `src/index.js`: The entry point of the application. It creates an instance of the Express app and listens on port 8001 without defining any endpoints.

- `Dockerfile`: Used to build a Docker image for the Express server. It specifies the base image, copies the source code into the image, installs the dependencies, and sets the command to run the server.

- `package.json`: The configuration file for npm, listing the dependencies (including Express and nodemon) and scripts for the project.

- `yarn.lock`: Automatically generated by Yarn to lock the versions of the dependencies installed in the project.

## Getting Started

To run the Express server, follow these steps:

1. Install the dependencies using Yarn:

   ```shell
   yarn install
   ```

2. Start the server with automatic restarts on code changes:

   ```shell
   yarn start
   ```

The server will be running on `http://localhost:8001`.
